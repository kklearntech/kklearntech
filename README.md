ðŸ‘‹ Hi, It's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm Kiruthika Kumarasamy, an enthusiast eager to embark on my cloud journey here. While I possess basic knowledge of cloud services, I've also gained practical experience through AWS projects, demonstrating proficiency in various AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, DynamoDB, Amazon Lex, Lambda, Quicksight, Rekognition, Polly, and DynamoDB. Additionally, I'm adept at using Docker and have a foundational understanding of Python.   


This repository marks my first foray into showcasing my technical skills in cloud computing. Alongside my technical expertise, I'm skilled in utilizing tools like Jira and Git for project management and tracking. I have prior experience in crafting business process documents to ensure clear understanding and alignment within the team regarding tasks, methods, and timelines.


In my current role as a SharePoint administrator, I handle tasks such as creating web applications and site collections, providing level 2 support, and acting as a business analyst to gather and translate business requirements into SharePoint solutions. I'm proficient in designing and deploying InfoPath forms and transitioning to Power Apps. Additionally, I have experience integrating Power Apps with Power Automate to streamline data flow and automate tasks, ultimately enhancing productivity and efficiency.
